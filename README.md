# EMT_bibliographic_analysis

 The scripts in this repo contain the code used to generate the figures and perform the analyses in the manuscript. I would recommend you start with the general WOS analysis since that is where we start reading the data and then proceed from there. If you face any issues or technical difficulties please do not hesitate to contact me at <a href=mailto:annicenajafi27@gmail.com>my email</a>.
